Over the years, I've been involved with various software development projects. Once an application shifts into a production, maintenance becomes essential - not just fixing bugs or shipping features, but ensuring the software remains secure, performant, and compatible with its evolving ecosystem.

One key aspect of maintenance is ensuring dependencies remain up-to-date. Outdated dependencies can **miss bug fixes, improvements and introduce security vulnerabilities**. However, as applications grow or additional applications need support, the task of manually tracking and updating dependencies can become increasingly error-prone and time-consuming.

Automating dependency updates is therefore key to ensuring bug fixes, improvements and security fixes are applied swiftly whilst limiting the growth of manual involvement from developers. In this post I'll share how I setup **Dependabot** initially before later adopting **Renovate** to handle my automation of updates.
